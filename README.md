=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomas-pecserke/UniversalMappings.png?branch=1.0)](https://travis-ci.org/tomas-pecserke/UniversalMappings)

This [Symfony 2](http://symfony.com/) component allows you to write your [Doctrine2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
model classes once for multiple mappings
([ORM](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/),
[MongoDB](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/),
[CouchDB](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/projects/doctrine-couchdb/en/latest/index.html)).
Let your bundle's users decide, which mapping they will use.
